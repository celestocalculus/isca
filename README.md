Light-weight session handler for .NET.

Iska lets you easily add and edit data on your session while it manages the session and clean-up. It cleans-up and persists your session data periodically to any storage you desire (file system, Azure blob, database, etc), hence it is crash-proof.

It is easy to initialize and use, and if you don't desire to persist your session, it still works just fine without any extension or customization.
